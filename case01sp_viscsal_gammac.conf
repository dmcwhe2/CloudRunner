# Description: Configuration file for Viscosity vs. Salinity Comparison by GAMMAC modification
# Dataset: Case01_SP
#
# Basic Info:
#   - Comments begin a line with #
#   - $some_env_var$ (outside of quotes) relies on the underlying shell to translate the variable
#   - Quoted strings are taken as literals
#

#
# Main block defines basic options
#
#  - exe = Path to simulator executable
#  - data = Path to original data directory
#  - simulator = Type of simulator (must be supported - this is to know how to analyze)
#  - output = Output files to analyze (should be relative to the path of the data directory after simulator is run) [Comma delimited]
#  - listKeys = Have slaves list their parameter keys they have parsed (useful for determining what parameters to analyze) [default = enabled]
#  - runName = Name to identify the results of this particular analysis
#  - runSim = Determine whether the simulation should be run. If the simulation was previously run through this tool, this
#             can be turned off (i.e. 0 or false) otherwise, any other value is interpreted as true and the simulation will be run
#  - symmetry = How to compute the modifications on the dataset either one of the following options:
#                  * symmetric (default) - Compute +/- on the percent change
#                  * positive  - Compute + (monotonically increasing) on the percent change
#                  * negative  - Compute - (monotonically decreasing) on the percent change
#
#  Graph properties (plan is to move this to its separate block in the future)
#    NOTE: These values are only used if they exist
#
#  - graph = Analyzed name of property of which to construct a connectivity graph
#  - lowerThresh = Lower threshold to filter data on (i.e minimum value)
#  - upperThresh = Upper threshold to filter data on (i.e. maximum value)
#

#
# Rules block defines rules for running different simulations 
#    for a dataset
# file "xxx" { ... } blocks are file names relative to the data directory
#
# file block options:
#
#  - start     = starting line number (inclusive)
#  - end       = ending line number (inclusive)
#  - modulo    = How frequently to use a particular rule in the given lines 
#                * This is useful for lines with different formats (for instance, every other)
#  - mval      = What the value of the modulo should equal when this rule is run
#  - format    = a "printf" string format (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/printf/)
#                * NOTE: This format will be used to read the line
#  - outformat = Output format in "printf" style
#  - transperc = Transformation percentage (i.e. vary values by +/- x%)
#  
#
# * Example: If modulo = 2 and mval = 0, then every even-numbered line within a range will apply the rule
#
# You can define multiple file blocks for a given file. However, if rules overlap,
# the decision is arbitrary as to what changes will be made
#

  # Modify GAMMAC from 20 - 100in

#
# Analysis block defines how the tool should mine the data
#	for a dataset
# parameter "xxx" { ... } blocks are relative to mining a particular parameter
#
# parameter block options (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled):
#  - sum      = The total sum of a given parameter
#  - mean     = Mine and report the mean for the given parameter
#  - variance = Mine and report the variance for the given parameter
#  - stddev   = Mine and report the standard deviation for the given parameter
#  - pearson  = Mine and report pearson's coefficient for the given parameter against the specified parameter
#  - norm     = Compute the norm between each graph using this parameter
#  - all      = All parameters which begin with the parameter string value
#
# NOTE: The non-existence of a parameter implies disabled
